# GitHub Actions workflows for WordPress

This repository holds reusable workflows for PMC's WordPress projects. These 
workflows are tailored to our specific needs and are not directly usable by 
other organizations, though they can provide a starting point for other 
organizations that maintain multiple WordPress themes and an accompanying 
set of plugins contained in a monorepo.
